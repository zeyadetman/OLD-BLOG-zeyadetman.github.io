# HashTables

Before we make a hashtable, let's talk about its components `arrays`, `functions`, and `hashing`. read them even if you know!

## Components

### Arrays?

`const colors = ['red','blue','orange']`

if we `console.log(colors[0])` the console displays the head which is `red`, we wrote the elements by this order and know what each index points to which color. This easy and explicit.

### Functions?

Functions are cool boxes, you pass it a value and tell it how to generate a result from it. ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Function_machine2.svg/1200px-Function_machine2.svg.png)

Have you ever wrote this in linear algebra class `f(x) = x+5`? in programming you can write it in same way `const f = x => x+5`, if we pass it a `3` the function returns `8` no fancy here.

### Hashing?

Hashing is kinda blackbox in tech talks, in other words it's a bunch of steps you're doing to convert a something to a unique `hash` or `value`, it's a oneway you can't go back. In programming we write those bunch of steps (hash Algorithm) in a function called hash function.

### Objects?

A key-value represented, like arrays but in array you get the value by index, in objects you get the value by its special key.

`const white = {code: '#fff', type: 'color'}`

If we want the `code` of `white` we simply write `white['code']`<sup>(1)</sup>, easy and fast huh?

## What is the hashtable?

In a simple sentence, Hashtable is data-structure to help you using an ordinary array as a key-value array!

### Let's exploring How?

We have a `colors` array like this:

```javascript
const  colors  = [{color:  'white', code:  '#fff'},
{color:  'orange', code:  '#fc3'}];
```

and The problem is we have to find the `code` of the color `orange`?!
without Hashtable the first naive solution is iterating the whole array and if color is orange display the code! slow, right?

```javascript
colors.map(color  =>
  {
    if (color['color'] ===  'orange')
    console.log(color['code']);
  }
);
```

Let's take another approach, converting it into a key-value array.
convert the last array to this array:

```javascript
const  colors  = ['#fff','#fc3'];
```
and if we write `colors['orange']` the console displays `#fc3`!
To do this we have to `hash` the word `white` and `orange` to be equal index in size which is `>=` zero and less than the array size.

```javascript
const  colors  = [];

const  hashFunction  =  key  => {
  const  letters  =  key.split('');
  const  hashValue  =  letters.reduce((acc, cur) =>
  acc  +  cur.charCodeAt(0), 0)
  % (!colors.length  ?  1  :  colors.length+1); 
  
  // in the line above, we made a '%' to range the
  // value to be between zero (included) and the length of
  // the list
  
  return  hashValue;
} 
colors[hashFunction('orange')] =  '#fc3';
colors[hashFunction('white')] =  '#fff';

console.log(colors[hashFunction('orange')]); // '#fc3'
```

Wow! that's Great! but if we have two colors return the same index we call it `Collision`, what should we do?!
In the actual implementations for the hashtable, the hash function must avoid the collision with two constraints:
 - The index must be unique for each word. 
 - The index must be `>=` zero and `<` list length.

#### Notes:
(1) Write it `white['code']` don't `white[code]` whatever you wrote `code` in the object to avoid conflicts between ordinary variables.
